## Ruby on Rails

### Taskinator

[virtualstaticvoid/taskinator][taskinator]

A simple orchestration library for running complex processes or workflows in Ruby. Processes are defined
using a simple DSL, where the sequences and tasks are defined. Processes can then be queued for execution.
Sequences can be synchronous or asynchronous, and the overall process can be monitored for completion or failure.

### Riveter

Provides several useful patterns, packaged in a gem, for use in Rails and other web based applications,
including generators to help improve consistency in your applications.

### Rails Simple Config

A simple YAML based configuration for Ruby on Rails 3+, which supports shared settings, ERB and more.

### Easy Enumerated Type

[virtualstaticvoid/ez_enum][ez_enum]

localization of constant names.
