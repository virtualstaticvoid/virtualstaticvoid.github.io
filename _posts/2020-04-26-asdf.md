title: ASDF Version Manager Plugins
---

Installing and managing the latest version of a command line tool can be a pain and very time consuming.

As developers we typically want to use the latest and greatest version of a tool before it becomes more widely
available via official deployment channels, such as `deb` or `snap` on Linux and `homebrew` on Mac.

Luckily, there is a simple version manager, [asdf][asdf], which makes life very easy with it's plugin capabilities.

There are many [plugins][plugins] provided by the community, including for:

* DotNet Core
* Crystal
* GitHub CLI
* Helm
* kubectx
* ...

And, creating plugins is easy. You need 3 shell scripts, namely:

* `bin/list-all` - lists all installable versions
* `bin/download` - download source code or binary for the specified version
* `bin/install` - installs the specified version

See the [official documentation][creating] for more details.

I spend a fair amount of time doing technical research, so often times there isn't a distribution of the command line tool
I'm testing out, so I usually resort to spending 10 to 15 minutes whipping up an asdf plugin for the given tool.

This involves creating a new repository on GitHub, from the [asdf-plugin-template][template] and then editing the
[`lib/utils.bash`][edits] file, providing the plugin name and GitHub repo URL of the tool in question.

Here are some of the plugins I've created:

* [`asdf-aws-vault`][asdf-aws-vault] - AWS Vault is a tool to securely store and access AWS credentials in a development environment.
* [`asdf-devspace`][asdf-devspace] - DevSpace is the next-generation tool for fast cloud-native software development.
* [`asdf-docker-compose`][asdf-docker-compose] - Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
* [`asdf-docker-machine`][asdf-docker-machine] - Machine lets you create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your own data center.
* [`asdf-glooctl`][asdf-glooctl] - Gloo is a feature-rich, Kubernetes-native ingress controller, and next-generation API gateway.
* [`asdf-grv`][asdf-grv] - GRV is a terminal interface for viewing git repositories.
* [`asdf-helm`][asdf-helm] - Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.
* [`asdf-istioctl`][asdf-istioctl] - Istio configuration command line utility for service operators to debug and diagnose their Istio mesh.
* [`asdf-k9s`][asdf-k9s] - Kubernetes CLI to manage your clusters in style.
* [`asdf-kubebuilder`][asdf-kubebuilder] - SDK for building Kubernetes APIs using CRDs.
* [`asdf-kubectx`][asdf-kubectx] - Faster way to switch between clusters and namespaces in kubectl.
* [`asdf-skaffold`][asdf-skaffold] -  For easy and repeatable Kubernetes development.
* [`asdf-sonarscanner`][asdf-sonarscanner] - SonarScanner is the scanner to use when there is no specific scanner for your build system.
* [`asdf-tilt`][asdf-tilt] - A multi-service dev environment for teams on Kubernetes.
