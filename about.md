<p class="message">
<b>Welcome</b> to my personal project showcase and blog on adventures in programming.
</p>

I am a passionate software engineer with 20+ years experience, versed in development
on Linux, Windows, Amazon Web Services and Kubernetes.

I specialise in data driven analytics for the financial investment management industry
and I have a good understanding of buy-side performance analytics, regulatory
compliance, ESG, risk and reporting.

After spending a number of years developing FMCG and retail systems, I moved into
development of front, middle and back-office systems for the financial services
industry. The most well-known products being:

* An investment management back and front-office system, Microgen AIMS.
* A regulatory and investment compliance system, StatPro Portfolio Control.
* The SalientQuants Portfolio Toolkit for hedge fund managers.
* A cloud based investment performance measurement system, Revolution Performance.

I have received several industry awards for technical innovation over the years.

I actively write code in Ruby, Python, Go, C#, R and Terraform. I have built software
libraries, designed frameworks, development tools, CI, CD and DevOps pipelines,
infrastructure as code, desktop, web and distributed cloud based applications,
in a variety of programming languages and technology stacks.

I am a Open Source contributor; the most widely used being the Heroku Buildpack for
R, which I actively maintain for a growing R data science community.

I enjoy learning and experimenting with new technologies and my personal interests
include spending time with my family, playing guitar and electronic music production.

I am currently based in Surrey in the UK.
