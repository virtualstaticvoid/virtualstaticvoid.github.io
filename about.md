<p class="message">
<b>Welcome</b> to my personal project showcase and blog on adventures in programming.
</p>

I am a system/solutions builder and polyglot programmer, specialising in data driven analytics type
software in the financial services and investment management industry for the last 18+ years.

I am currently based in Surrey in the UK.

After spending a number of years developing FMCG and retail systems, I moved into development of
front, middle and back-office type systems for the financial services industry. The most well-known
products being an investment management back and front-office system, Microgen AIMS, a regulatory
and investment compliance system, StatPro Portfolio Control, the SalientQuants Portfolio Toolkit
for hedge fund managers, and a cloud based investment performance measurement system,
StatPro Revolution Performance, which has received a number of industry awards for technical innovation.

I have extensive knowledge and experience of a variety of platforms and software development stacks,
including current cloud technologies, and I still actively cut code in a number of languages
including C#, Ruby, Go and R.

I am a Open Source contributor; of which the most widely used project is the Heroku Buildpack for R,
which I actively maintain for a growing R data science community.

I am currently Head of Engineering at [Confluence][confluence] and responsible for the high-level technical
architecture, working with our development teams in London, Milan, Montreal, New York, Pittsburgh and Cape Town.

Other interests include playing guitar, electronic music production and my motorcycle.

Have questions or want to get in touch? Feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:virtualstaticvoid@gmail.com).

You can also connect with me professionally via [LinkedIn][linkedin] or checkout my [professional GitHub][github] account.

Thanks for reading!
